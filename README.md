# react-zine TodoMVC Example

This is a TodoMVC implementation intended to illustrate the use of [react-zine](https://github.com/j-s-n/react-zine).

It's a work in progress, and probably isn't fully compliant with the official [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/) guidelines yet.

The final output is compiled from ES6 sources in `src/`. Check out `src/store.js` for an example of one way to build a reactive store using react-zine, and check out `src/app.js` to see how easy it is to connect a store up to a view built from React components.
